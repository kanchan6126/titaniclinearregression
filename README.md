# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using a machine learning classifier. The dataset contains various passenger attributes used to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, embarkation point, etc.
- The target variable is `Survived` indicating if a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn


## Project Overview
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values in features like `Age` and `Cabin`.
   - Encoding categorical variables such as `Sex` and `Embarked`.
   - Feature scaling (if required).
2. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. Training a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree).
4. Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## How to Run
- Place the Titanic dataset file (`train.csv` or similar) in the project directory.
- Run the classification script.
- Outputs include model evaluation metrics printed to the console.

## Notes
- Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning are key steps for improving accuracy.
- Addressing class imbalance can further improve predictive performance.
- This approach applies general supervised learning techniques to tabular data.
